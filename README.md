# 03-flex-header-2

For this one you will probably need to edit the HTML a little bit. 

Often with flexbox you need to add containers around things to make them go where you need them to go. 

In this case, you probably want to separate the items that go on the left and right of the header.

Just like you did in the 02-flex-header exercise, you'll be nesting flex containers inside each other.

This one needs to be flexible in the middle, with items pushed to the left and right.
